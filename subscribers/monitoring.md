# Monitoring Subscriber Services

Effective monitoring is essential for maintaining reliable service access and ensuring your subscriber contracts operate smoothly. Utilizing the auto-topper script for continuous contract monitoring has proven highly effective, providing proactive management and automated renewal to ensure uninterrupted service.

## Account Balance Monitoring

It's crucial to monitor your hot wallet's account balance regularly to ensure you maintain sufficient funds for automated transactions and fees. You can quickly check your account balance using the following command:

```
arkeod query bank balances <your-provider-account-address>
```

Replace <your-provider-account-address> with your specific Arkeo account address.

Regular balance checks help prevent disruptions due to insufficient funds and ensure your auto-topper script and other contract management processes run smoothly.
