# Subscriber Initial Setup Guide

Connecting securely and reliably to Arkeo provider services requires thoughtful initial setup. This guide covers key considerations, security practices, and the provider discovery process to ensure you get started correctly.

## Initial Considerations and Security

### Key Security

- Always safeguard your private keys; never share them publicly.
- For automation and script interactions, use a dedicated keyring backend (`test`). Refer to the [Security Documentation](#) for details on safe key management practices.
- Regularly back up your keys securely to prevent data loss.

## Selecting the Right Service

Determine clearly which service type you require and confirm its numeric identifier from the service mapping chart below. Correct service selection ensures compatibility and reliability.

### Provider Discovery

Use the following command to find reliable providers offering your chosen service type:

```
arkeod query arkeo list-providers --output json | \
jq '.provider[] | select(.status=="ONLINE" and .service==<service-number>)'
```

Replace <service-number> with the numeric identifier corresponding to your chosen service.

### Provider Evaluation

Before choosing a provider, carefully check:
- Provider metadata (accessible via their advertised metadata_uri).
- Contract terms such as rate, minimum duration, and settlement details.
- Provider reputation and reliability based on community feedback.
