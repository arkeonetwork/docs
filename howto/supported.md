# What Data Does Arkeo Support?

Every Provider we onboard is unique, this means we are always growing the data offering we support.  As each type of supported data is routed within the Arkeo blockchain, we have to upgrade and add services periodically.

Here is how you can view what's currently supported:

```
arkeod query arkeo all-services
```
```
http://localhost:1317/arkeo/services
```
