# Arkeo Airdrop

## Airdrop Closed

The initial Arkeo airdrop period has officially ended. All previously allocated but unclaimed tokens have been returned to the Arkeo network reserve. We thank everyone for their participation and support.

## Original Airdrop Distribution (for reference)
The initial airdrop of ARKEO tokens was distributed among a broad variety of communities to encourage diverse participation in the Arkeo network.

## Original Claiming Process (now closed)
Users were required to take multiple actions to receive their full airdrop allocation:

- 1/3 was sent upon initial claim.
- 1/3 was sent after delegating Arkeo tokens to a validator.
- 1/3 was sent after participating in governance.

Ethereum users claimed their tokens by transferring from their designated Ethereum address to their Arkeo address via a signed message.

Eligible Arkeo native addresses were provided a small amount of ARKEO at genesis to cover the gas fees necessary to claim their tokens.

To incentivize timely claims, the claimable airdrop amount reduced over time:

- Full amount claimable for the first month (`DurationUntilDecay`).
- Linear decay in the claimable amount from the 1st to the 2nd month (`DurationOfDecay`).
- After two months, unclaimed tokens reverted to the reserve.

## THORChain Users
THORChain's unique BIP-44 coin type (931) required an additional step to transfer allocated tokens from a THORChain-derived address to an Arkeo address. This transfer could only be performed once per claim.

## Continuing Participation
Even though the airdrop has concluded, you can continue to engage with the Arkeo network by:

- Delegating ARKEO tokens to validators.
- Participating in governance proposals.
- Becoming a data provider or subscriber.

We appreciate your continued interest and involvement in the Arkeo community!
