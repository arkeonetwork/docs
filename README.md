# Arkeo Network Documentation

Arkeo is a decentralized, free-market network providing reliable and censorship-resistant access to blockchain data. Unlike traditional centralized data providers (e.g., Infura and Alchemy), Arkeo empowers users and data providers with trustless interactions, transparent pricing, and community-driven quality assurance. Arkeo aims to create a truly decentralized alternative for accessing blockchain data, enhancing web3 self-reliance and privacy.

## The Arkeo Solution

Arkeo's solution centers on three core concepts:

- Free-Market Data Providers: Anyone can operate as a data provider, offering blockchain data at prices determined by market competition, allowing for efficient price discovery.
- Trustless Payments: Users can securely pay providers using any IBC-enabled asset, with flexible micro-payments and options for subscription or usage-based contracts.
- Transparent On-Chain Reputation: Provider performance and reliability are publicly verifiable through on-chain data, facilitating informed choices based on provider reputation and quality.

## How Arkeo Works

Here's a concise breakdown of how Arkeo functions:

- Individuals operate full blockchain nodes and become data providers, setting their own pricing for data queries.
- Users establish contracts directly with data providers, depositing tokens on-chain. Contracts support both subscription and pay-as-you-go models.
- Each query is cryptographically verifiable and redeemable on-chain, ensuring trustless and transparent income for data providers.
- A portion (10%) of provider earnings contributes to the network reserve, which funds validator incentives through block rewards.
- Providers build transparent reputations through public on-chain metrics, including service quality, user retention, income stability, and provider longevity.

Arkeo ensures decentralized and dependable blockchain data access, positioning itself as the robust web3 alternative to centralized infrastructure providers.
